## Peer to peer file backup system
This is a system developed for a class at UBC. It was built by three students: Sergey Skovorodnikov, Rohin Patel, Jonathan McGrandle.

## Description
Each user permits other users to store N bytes on their disk and runs a client (bot) to operate on that space.

## Unimplemented functionlity
- Message signing between the CNC and clients is not implemented. There was an attempt to write "Authority" server, but it was not finished due to time constraints. 
- Some code in Indexer.go is not finished for the same reason.
